### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kim. Learning Chinese since August 2017. Software engineer since
2013.

Since 2022 back at university studying Artificial Intelligence, not because of
the hype, but just because it's one of the few things I haven't learned yet that
I would really like to learn.

- [x] ðŸ“• Webdevelopment (4y)
- [x] ðŸ“— Software Engineering foundation year (1y)
- [ ] ðŸ“˜ Artificial Intelligence BSc (3y)
- [ ] ðŸ“™ Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems MSc (2.5y)
